# ðŸŽ“ Student Score Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **student exam performance** based on academic, socio-economic, and personal factors using **Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to analyze key factors, perform feature selection, and build regression models to evaluate prediction accuracy.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Records:** 6,607 students  
- **Features:** Academic performance, study habits, parental involvement, family income, access to resources, motivation level, and more.  
- **Target:** `Exam_Score`

---

## ðŸ›  Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values using mode imputation
   - Outlier detection with IQR method
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Normalization using MinMaxScaler

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Boxplots & histograms for distribution analysis  
   - Correlation heatmap for numeric features  
   - ANOVA & Eta-Squared for categorical importance  

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Manual selection based on statistics & visualization  
   - Automatic selection using `SelectKBest (f_regression)`  

4. **Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression** on:
     - Manually selected features  
     - SelectKBest features  
     - Raw dataset  
   - **Polynomial Regression** (degree=2) on raw dataset  

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RÂ² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Visualizations: True vs Predicted plots, residuals distribution, model comparison bar chart

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- **Linear Regression (Raw dataset)** performed best:  
  - Train RÂ² â‰ˆ **0.717**  
  - Test RÂ² â‰ˆ **0.770**  
  - MSE â‰ˆ **3.26**  

- Polynomial Regression slightly underperformed compared to Linear Regression.
